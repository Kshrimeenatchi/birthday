    <p contenteditable="true">Dear Aditi akka,</p> 
    <p contenteditable="true">Happy birthday &#10084;!! I don’t know you personally but through the news and other informational ways.You are genuinely a very generous and humble person.Your personality makes you unique from others, may you live thousands and thousands of years. Happy birthday to my charming star&#127775;.You are an absolute gem. I don't know how to describe my love for you, I have never seen celebrities engage with commoners in this way, but you do and that makes me to stand more for you akka.You made me feel like I was talking to a family member, even though I've never met you  
      .In fact, this page is insufficient for properly conveying my love &#128151;, so let me end it with saying. 
      Onwards and upwardss onlyy!!
